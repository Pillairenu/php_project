1.Use Constants for Route Paths:Instead of using hardcoded strings as route paths,
  consider defining constants for these paths. This can make your code more maintainable and help prevent typos.
  eg: define('ROOT', '/');
      define('SIGNIN', '/signin');

      $routes = [
        ROOT => 'controllers/index.php',
        SIGNIN => 'controllers/signin.php',
        // Define other routes here
    ];
