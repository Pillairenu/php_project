1.Use Constants for Route Paths:Instead of using hardcoded strings as route paths,
  consider defining constants for these paths. This can make your code more maintainable and help prevent typos.
  eg: define('ROOT', '/');
      define('SIGNIN', '/signin');

      $routes = [
        ROOT => 'controllers/index.php',
        SIGNIN => 'controllers/signin.php',
        // Define other routes here
    ];

    My response:I would like to implement it.

 2. In add property.view: 

        Labels and Input Fields:

        Consider using the for attribute in your <label> tags to associate them with the corresponding input fields using the id attribute. This improves accessibility and allows users to click on the label to focus on the input field.
        html
    
        <label for="unit-number">Unit Number:</label>
        <input type="text" id="unit-number" name="unit-number" required>

        My response:I have already implemented it in my code.
