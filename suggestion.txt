1.Use Constants for Route Paths:Instead of using hardcoded strings as route paths,
  consider defining constants for these paths. This can make your code more maintainable and help prevent typos.
  eg: define('ROOT', '/');
      define('SIGNIN', '/signin');

      $routes = [
        ROOT => 'controllers/index.php',
        SIGNIN => 'controllers/signin.php',
        // Define other routes here
    ];

    My response:I would like to implement it.

    I did this during the lab time.It's done and working.

 2. In add property.view: 

        Labels and Input Fields:

        Consider using the for attribute in your <label> tags to associate them with the corresponding input fields using the id attribute. This improves accessibility and allows users to click on the label to focus on the input field.
        html
    
        <label for="unit-number">Unit Number:</label>
        <input type="text" id="unit-number" name="unit-number" required>

        My response:I have already implemented it in my code. 


        Select Options:

        Ensure that your <select> elements have a default "Select" or "Choose" option with a disabled attribute to prompt users to make a selection. This can help prevent accidental submissions.
        html
        Copy code
        <select id="property-type" name="property-type" required>
            <option value="" disabled selected>Select Property Type</option>
            <option value="room">Room</option>
            <option value="apartment">Apartment</option>
            <option value="house">House</option>
        </select>

         My response:I might implement it since I didn't have a default "Select" or "Choose" option.

    3. Mobile Responsiveness:

        Consider how the view displays on different devices and screen sizes. Ensure that it's mobile-responsive and user-friendly.

        My response:I'm planning to implement it is one of the most important part of an app to view it in different screen.


    4. Suggestions in favorite.view.php     

        Dynamic Data:

        If this page is meant to display a list of favorite properties, 
        you should dynamically populate this page with data from your backend.
         Consider using a loop to iterate through your list of favorite properties and generate the HTML dynamically. 
        This makes your code more maintainable and scalable.

        My response:I'm going to establish a database connection and dynamically populate data.

    5. To provide the user with the option to choose between "customer" and "real estate agent" during the signup process.
        My Response: It's important since the customer and the agent have unique functionalities.

        I did this during the lab time.It's done and working.
        
    6. Crtique from Students

        Student notes: Improve code documentation, organization, and commit
        frequency while adding advanced filtering options for better user experience and future
        development.
        The design of the site looks so clean and precisely
        designed. Clearly represent the goal of the site. the
        things she needs to work on commits, and she needs to
        understand why it is essential. Also, she needs to work on
        responsiveness, which is missing in this milestone.
        Add a filter to the apartment
        for filtering listings you could have an attribute section in the database for bedrooms, cost, etc and then make that searchable
